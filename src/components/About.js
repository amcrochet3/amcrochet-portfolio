                        <p className='text-left intro'>After nearly a decade in academia and creative roles, I decided in Spring 2023 to explore coding through <strong>Hackbright Academy's immersive software engineering fellowship</strong>. Originally wanting to gain a solid programming background to complement my <strong>M.S. in UX Design from Georgia Tech</strong>, I became enthralled by the limitless possibilities underlying the ability to craft digital products from a technological standpoint. So, I decided to leverage my interdisciplinary background in making a full pivot into software engineering! Below are some projects I’ve completed since graduating from Hackbright. I love working with data and delving into <strong>APIs</strong>. Recently, I am interested in <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>data science</strong> concepts.</p>
